# SpaceCombatSimulation
A Unity 3D project to simulate combat between space ships with vaguely realistic physics - Space ships are not aeroplanes!

TODO:
Ships should be able to try to get to a specific distance.
Clean up reticles of dead ships - make reticle a child.
Moving towards target picker for missiles
Moving towards detonator for missiles
Engines handle their own fuel.
Camera controller to handle zoom - active when camera is active
Camera controller should allow panning also
Improve generation management - make it a bit more random.


Engines only fire when pointed in the right direction.
improve muzzle flashes.
Make mini type 2 actually manage to hit torpedoes.
Handle very high speed collisions -sort of done.
use engines to turn.

Bugs:
Beams don't turn off when the turret dies.
