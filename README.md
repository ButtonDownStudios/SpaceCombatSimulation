# SpaceCombatSimulation
A Unity 3D project to simulate combat between space ships with vaguely realistic physics - Space ships are not aeroplanes!

TODO:
Use projectile velocity instead of speed for velocity correction - relevant to rockets specifically.
Ships should be able to try to get to a specific distance.
Have beam turret controller set beam colour instead of each beam.
Moving towards target picker for missiles
Moving towards detonator for missiles
Engines handle their own fuel.
Camera controller to handle zoom - active when camera is active
Camera controller should allow panning also
Improve generation management - make it a bit more random.

Make shipSam point at the target of the followed object (if there is one)

Engines only fire when pointed in the right direction.
improve muzzle flashes.
Make mini type 2 actually manage to hit torpedoes.
Handle very high speed collisions -sort of done.
use engines to turn.

Bugs:
Graphical - Beams don't turn off when the turret dies.
