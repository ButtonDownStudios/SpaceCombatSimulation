# SpaceCombatSimulation
A Unity 3D project to simulate combat between space ships with vaguely realistic physics - Space ships are not aeroplanes!

TODO:
improve muzzle flashes.
Make mini type 2 actually manage to hit torpedoes.
Make explosions do damage.
Handle very high speed collisions
Moving towards detonator for missiles
Finish configuring behavior variables on ships.
Ships should be able to try to get to a specific distance.
Camera controller to handle zoom - active when camera is active
