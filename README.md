# SpaceCombatSimulation
A Unity 3D project to simulate combat between space ships with vaguely realistic physics - Space ships are not aeroplanes!

TODO:
Make explosions do damage.
Finish configuring behavior variables on ships.
Moving towards detonator for missiles
Ships should be able to try to get to a specific distance.
Engines handle their own fuel.
Camera controller to handle zoom - active when camera is active
Camera controller should allow panning also

Engines only fire when pointed in the right direction.
improve muzzle flashes.
Make mini type 2 actually manage to hit torpedoes.
Handle very high speed collisions
use engines to turn.
