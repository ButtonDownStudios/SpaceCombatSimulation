# SpaceCombatSimulation
A Unity 3D project to simulate combat between space ships with vaguely realistic physics - Space ships are not aeroplanes!

TODO:
Make 3 different types of ship hub look different
Indicate front of main ship module
Engines only fire when pointed in the right direction.
improve muzzle flashes.
Make mini type 2 actually manage to hit torpedoes.
Make explosions do damage.
Handle very high speed collisions
Moving towards detonator for missiles
Finish configuring behavior variables on ships.
Ships should be able to try to get to a specific distance.
Camera controller to handle zoom - active when camera is active
use engines to turn.
